      'legend': '''**Legend of Kaldi the Goat Herder:**
      
In the 9th century, a young goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats becoming energetic and "dancing" after eating red berries from a certain bush. Curious, Kaldi tried the berries himself and felt invigorated.

He brought the berries to a local monastery, where monks initially threw them into a fire, declaring them the "devil's work." But the roasting beans produced such an enticing aroma that the monks retrieved them, ground them, and mixed with water - creating the first coffee.

The drink helped monks stay awake during long prayers, and coffee spread throughout Ethiopia and eventually the world.''',
