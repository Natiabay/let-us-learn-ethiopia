Ethiopia uses a unique calendar that is 7-8 years behind the Gregorian calendar!

**Key Differences:**

**Year Count:**
- Currently: 2017 in Ethiopian calendar (while 2025 in Gregorian)
- 7-8 year difference (varies by month)
- Based on Coptic calendar
- Unchanged since ancient times

**Months:**
Ethiopia has 13 months!
1. **Meskerem** (መስከረም) - September 11-October 10
2. **Tikimt** (ጥቅምት) - October 11-November 9
3. **Hidar** (ኅዳር) - November 10-December 9
4. **Tahsas** (ታህሳስ) - December 10-January 8
5. **Tir** (ጥር) - January 9-February 7
6. **Yekatit** (የካቲት) - February 8-March 9
7. **Megabit** (መጋቢት) - March 10-April 8
8. **Miazia** (ሚያዝያ) - April 9-May 8
9. **Ginbot** (ግንቦት) - May 9-June 7
10. **Sene** (ሰኔ) - June 8-July 7
11. **Hamle** (ሐምሌ) - July 8-August 6
12. **Nehase** (ነሐሴ) - August 7-September 5
13. **Pagumen** (ጳጉሜን) - September 6-10 (5-6 days only!)

**Structure:**
- 12 months of 30 days each = 360 days
- 13th month (Pagumen) = 5 days (6 in leap year)
- Total = 365 days (366 leap year)
- Simple and logical

**Time System:**
Ethiopia also has unique time!
- **Day starts at sunrise** (6 AM Gregorian = 0:00 Ethiopian)
- **12:00 noon Gregorian = 6:00 Ethiopian**
- **6:00 PM Gregorian = 12:00 Ethiopian (start of night)**
- Can be confusing for travelers!
- Always clarify "Ethiopian time" vs "ferenj (foreign) time"

**New Year (Enkutatash):**
- September 11 (or 12 in leap year)
- Means "gift of jewels"
- Spring season in Ethiopia
- Flowers blooming
- End of rainy season
- Major celebration

**Practical Tips for Tourists:**
- Hotels use Gregorian calendar
- Airlines use Gregorian time
- Appointments: Always clarify which system
- Ask "Ethiopian or ferenj time?"
- Most Ethiopians comfortable with both
- Smartphone apps show both calendars''',
